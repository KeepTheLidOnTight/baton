# Future enhancements

Baton is intentionally a local POC built on fictional CSV exports. Before real
teams depend on it, I would add:

- Read-only CRM or Apollo context with least-privilege access.
- Salesforce automation that prepares a handoff draft when a Closed Won deal has
  its required handoff fields populated. A person reviews the draft and triggers
  the handoff before it is recorded.
- A reviewed process for corrections and ownership changes.
- Team-specific handoff policies instead of one prototype policy.
- Access controls, retention rules, monitoring, retries, and evaluation on
  labeled real handoffs.

These are not implemented in the demo. The current version stays focused on the
decision it is designed to support: does this supplied handoff contain enough
context for the receiving team?
